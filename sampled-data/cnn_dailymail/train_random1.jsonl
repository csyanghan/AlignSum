As of Monday, they were still seen in a neighbor's yard  Alyssa says she went outside to check on her sibling, who is deaf, when she heard his screams and spotted a trio of large rottweilers biting the child in the brush by a dirt road. Setting aside concerns for her own safety, Alyssa ran over and scared off the hounds so she could tend to Elijah. The wounded boy could stand up or walk on his own, so his little sister picked him up and carried him home. 'I was terrified, but I saved his life,' Alyssa told News Channel 4. When Elijah was brought to a nearby hospital for treatment, he immediately went into surgery. The injured child, who turned 11 Tuesday, was later released home with 40 staples on his head. He is now learning to walk again.

{"article": "Charity runners taking part in a 10km fun run at the weekend were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour. The blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the event, missing 300 runners who should have been directed at a junction point. Instead they continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route. Scroll down for video  Blunder: Charity runners taking part in yesterday's Bournemouth Bay 10K Run (pictured) were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour The bizarre gaffe happened during yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run and today the organisers - Bournemouth Borough Council - appealed for those who were affected by the mix-up to contact them for a 'gesture of goodwill.' A local authority spokesman said that it was investigating what happened to the marshal who should have directed runners at a turning point. It was reported that some runners were 'in tears' while one described the event's organisation as 'shambolic'.  Hayley James, who is four months pregnant and from Poole, said: 'To have a race of that scale with only one marshal on a point is inexcusable. 'We saw loads of people walking at the end, some were in tears, I felt so sorry for them - I felt like crying at the 10km mark.' Andy Isaac, from Bournemouth, said the event was 'mayhem' with one point where an elderly woman managed to drive onto the route and was flashing her lights at oncoming runners.  A map shows where up to 300 runners continued along the coastal path after a marshal who was meant to direct them on to a turn went to the toilet Reaction: Two people vent their frustration at the Bournemouth Bay Run on Twitter yesterday It also emerged that water stations ran out of supplies during the race, forcing some runners to drink from half-empty bottles that had been left on the ground as they battled against dehydration. Commenting on the Daily Echo website, one runner said: \"We had a bottle of water at the three mile station, but at the six mile point they had totally ran out, so nothing. Jon Weaver, head of resort marketing and events at the council, said: 'Unfortunately there was some confusion with marshalling arrangements at one point, but it was a critical point. We apologise unreservedly to those front runners. 'In 33 years of running... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully... to learn for 2016. 'We understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling.' It was hoped that the event would have raised more than £70,000 for the British Heart Foundation.  Some racers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the blunder. Rob Kelly wrote: Really disappointed in the #BournemouthBayRun 10k that ended up 13k very poor show bad marshalling #wontbeback.'

Muhammad Ali had been banned from boxing for three-and-a-half years for refusing induction into the US military to fight in Vietnam – but as a consequence become the darling of the young, the black and the Civil Rights movement. Joe Frazier found himself unwittingly the standard bearer for the white establishment.  Ali fanned the flames by labelling the simpler man who would become his arch-rival an 'Uncle Tom,' the most wounding insult for an African American There was a foretaste of the current scramble for Mayweather-Pacquaio tickets. Woody Allen was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the Garden. Frank Sinatra persuaded Life magazine to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer.  Fast-talking Ali offensively labelled Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' due to the support he got from white conservatives  Referee Tony Perez, widely believed to have acted leniently in Ali's favour, orders the pair to their corners JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York  Author Norman Mailer reported on the fight. Actor Burt Lancaster picked up a TV microphone for his only stint as a colour commentator. Artist Leroy Neiman sat at his easel painting Ali and Frazier as they fought. This was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history. Ali came out fast to dominate the first three rounds. Frazier, encouraged by catching Ali with the last punch of the third, launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy.  Ali's speed of hand, dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment – along with a little help from referee Arthur Mercante who declined to call a knock down when Frazier sent him crashing in the eighth.  Ali is laid out on the canvas as Frazier is send to the corner before a long 10-count in the 15th round  Somehow, heroically, survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds. Still some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round. There all argument was ended. Frazier caught him with the most wicked of all those trademark left hooks and this time there was no denying a count which appeared to edge a fraction longer than the stipulated ten seconds.  Ali rose to his feet. Unsteadily. His jaw grotesquely swollen. Again his courage carried him to the bell. The decision was unanimously in favour of Frazier, although both men went to hospital. Frazier got the unanimous decision from the judges but both men went to hospital after the epic bout Very late that night word spread through New York's animated bars that one of them had died. Frazier checked out early, quietly. Ali pronounced the rumours of his passing to be premature. Their trilogy was born. They were to fight twice more and on one of those occasions each would come close to death again.", "id": "36", "highlights": "Floyd Mayweather jr and Manny Pacquiao's fight will be the richest ever..

{"article": "Not only does Gareth Bale definitely want to stay at Real Madrid beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world.  Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid.  Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's £86million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify.  His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend.  Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for £18million All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.", "id": "28", "highlights": "Gareth Bale has been linked with a summer move to Manchester United..

{"article": "The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is one of the icons of the Cold War - a self-contained and sufficient town buried under the Rockies meant to be impervious to a Soviet nuclear barrage. It was home to the North American Aerospace Command (NORAD), scanning the skies for Russian missiles and the military command and control center of the United States in the event of World War Three. The high tech base entered popular culture with appearances in the 1983 Cold War thriller War Games and 1994's Stargate - which imagined the complex as a clandestine home for intergalactic travel. Scroll down for video  Secret: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado was built for NORAD to direct the American response to a nuclear war with the USSR during the Cold War Protection: There are 15 three story building inside the military complex and each is buffered by a 25-ton blast door Small town: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is home to more than 1,000 personnel and is able to operate as an underground town for months with fresh water and food It shut down nearly ten years ago as the threat from Russia seemed to subside, but this week the Pentagon announced that Cheyenne Mountain will once again be home to the most advanced tracking and communications equipment in the United States military. The shift to the Cheyenne Mountain base in Colorado is designed to safeguard the command's sensitive sensors and servers from a potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, military officers said. The Pentagon last week announced a $700 million contract with Raytheon Corporation to oversee the work for North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) and US Northern Command. Admiral William Gortney, head of NORAD and Northern Command, said that 'because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain's built, it's EMP-hardened.' Power: At its height Cheyenne was home to NORAD who watched 7,000 aircraft per day as part of their surveillance operations Headquarters: The US and Canadian military jointly operated NORAD from within Cheyenne and soldiers from north of the border made up 15 percent of the personnel at the base Around-the-clock crews monitor U.S. skies from the command center of the Northern Command  located deep within Cheyenne Mountain at the foot of the Rocky Mountains near Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2002 'And so, there's a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there,' Gortney told reporters. 'My primary concern was... are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there, and I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there,' he said. The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack. From inside the massive complex, airmen were poised to send warnings that could trigger the launch of nuclear missiles. But in 2006, officials decided to move the headquarters of NORAD and US Northern Command from Cheyenne to Petersen Air Force base in Colorado Springs. The Cheyenne bunker was designated as an alternative command center if needed. Almost 10 years ago, the military closed the secretive defense complex carved into Cheyenne Mountain that for decades monitored American skies for threats. The North American Aerospace Defense Command operations center was moved to nearby Peterson Air Force Base, which is home to the U.S. Northern Command created after the Sept. 11 attacks. Cheyenne Mountain Complex is 2,000 feet below the granite rocks and made up of 15 three-story buildings protected from nuclear blasts and seismic movement by a system of 1,000 giant springs. The entire complex is designed to withstand a direct hit by a 30 megaton nuclear explosion and has 25-ton blast doors surrounding the complex. NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian command, was set up in the 1960s to monitor the skies for threats like missiles, aircraft and space objects. In 2006, Adm. Tim Keating, who commanded both NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command, said the government's best intelligence 'led them to believe a missile attack from China or Russia was very unlikely.' Cold War heroes: The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack That, along with the emergence of varied terrorist threats such as suicide bombers, 'was why we recommended that we don't need to maintain Cheyenne Mountain in a 24/7 status. We can put it on `warm standby,' said Keating. About 1,100 people work in the mountain, long a symbol of the Cold War. Buildings inside it are mounted on springs to absorb the shock from a nuclear blast, while the entrance is guarded by a vault-like door several feet thick. The complex includes banks of batteries and its own water supply. Excavation on the site began in 1961. Canadian crews stationed at Cheyenne Mountain will also made the move to Peterson, Keating said. Hollywood: Sci-fi movie Stargate (1994) was set inside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex while 1983's War Games also imagine a nuclear standoff operated from inside the nuclear bunker That move was touted a more efficient use of resources but had followed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of modernization work at Cheyenne carried out after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Now the Pentagon is looking at shifting communications gear to the Cheyenne bunker, officials said. 'A lot of the back office communications is being moved there,' said one defense official. Officials said the military's dependence on computer networks and digital communications makes it much more vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse, which can occur naturally or result from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. Under the 10-year contract, Raytheon is supposed to deliver 'sustainment' services to help the military perform 'accurate, timely and unambiguous warning and attack assessment of air, missile and space threats' at the Cheyenne and Petersen bases. Raytheon's contract also involves unspecified work at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.", "id": "29", "highlights": "Cheyenne Mountain Complex being refurbished by pengaton..

{"article": "A new vaccine to stimulate the body's immune system could offer a cure for HIV. The 'kick and kill' strategy aims to eradicate the virus, by stimulating the immune system - the body's natural defence mechanism - with a vaccine. Researchers believe the injection could flush out dormant HIV hiding in white blood cells with a chemical 'kick', allowing a boosted immune system to identify and kill the cells. The theory, developed by researchers at University College London, the University of Oxford and the University of North Carolina, is based on a single patient case study. Scientists hope a new 'kick and kill' vaccine could flush out HIV hidden in the body before stimulating a person's own immune system to kill the cells  'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails,' study co-author Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said. 'We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, as we still need to develop and test effective vaccines, but this study takes us one step closer by showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce.'  The study looked at a single 59-year-old man in London who was an 'elite controller' - meaning his immune system could control HIV for a long period of time without his needing treatment. Elite controllers, who make up 0.3 per cent of HIV patients, eventually require treatment to prevent progression to AIDS. But they can go a lot longer without treatment because their immune systems are more active against HIV.   The patient in the study had both HIV and myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.  The bone marrow produces white blood cells, including those that help to control HIV. Pioneering new treatments for HIV, flu, ebola and cancer are being developed by scientists harnessing man-made DNA. Experts have discovered how to create strands of artificial DNA, each mimicking a different killer disease, and inject them into patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will then be able to recognise the threats and eliminate them. Inovio, one of the companies behind the technique, has begun trials in humans, after strong results in the lab. The American company is using the method to attack flu, ebola and certain types of cancer – as well as HIV and hepatitis. Experts have already started trials on female patients to see if they can stop them developing cervical cancer.  To treat the patient's myeloma, his bone marrow was completely removed and replaced using his own stem cells.  When the bone marrow was removed, the immune system was severely impaired, allowing the HIV to re-activate and replicate.  This caused the level of virus in his bloodstream to rise from fewer than 50 copies per millilitre to approximately 28,000 copies per ml before is immune system's function returned. When the patient's immune function returned about two weeks after the transplant, the levels of HIV in his bloodstream rapidly fell.  His immune system reduced HIV levels at a similar rate to the most powerful treatments available, bringing them back down to 50 copies per ml within six weeks. Professor Deenan Pillay, also of UCL, said: 'By measuring the strength of the immune system required to keep this virus under control in this rare individual, we have a better idea of the requirements for successful future treatment.  'We also managed to identify the specific immune cells that fought the infection.  'This is a single patient study, but nevertheless it is often the unusual patients who help us to understand the HIV disease process.' The man was not given any anti-HIV drugs, due to concerns about side-effects affecting his cancer treatment. The researchers noted it is possible that an equally strong immune response in combination with powerful drugs could have cured the HIV completely, however they state that is far from certain.   Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said: 'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails. We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, but this study takes us one step closer, showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce' 'We need to be cautious in interpreting observations from a single subject,' said Dr Nilu Goonetilleke, who began working on the study at the University of Oxford and is now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  'However, demonstration even from a single subject, that our immune system can rapidly control HIV-1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination.' Dr Gupta adds: 'Drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant HIV are still imperfect, and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the HIV from the body.  'Likewise, it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal HIV patient's immune system to kill HIV with the full strength of an elite controller.  'Our study is a proof of principle and the results are promising, but it is unlikely to lead to a cure for at least a decade.' The study was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.", "id": "45", "highlights": "Scientists believe future vaccine could trigger body's immune system.. Could flush out dormant HIV hiding in the body allowing the immune system to identify and target virus cells.. Theory based on one case study, 59-year-old man with HIV whose virus load - amount of HIV in his blood - drop dramatically after treatment.", "pseudo_summary": "Scientists think that a new vaccine, which can stimulate human’s immune system by the 'kick and kill' strategy, can eradicate the virus and offer a cure for HIV. A 59-year-old man has been investigated to show what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce. Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said that it’s still a long way to cure HIV, but this study takes us one step closer."}

{"article": "Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is unsure whether a planned boycott by Newcastle fans will prove a help or hindrance to his side this weekend. This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood.

{"article": "The UK's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the Labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia. And in her first interview since she announced Lord Janner would not face trial she refused to quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'.  Fighting back: Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quit Victims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling – even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution.  Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched  - but decided it was now too late to charge him. She told the Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. 'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist.  'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions.  'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.' Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial Last night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial. Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state.  And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year. The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed. The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation. The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home. In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid Even earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial. He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons Mr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.' Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.' A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'.

It won him the top spot on the annual Bloomberg Pay Index. Slumping to second place, Chenerie Energy's Houston-based chief executive Charif Souki was valued at $281 million. And now the firm has announced it is cutting his pay. In his prime: GoPro creator Nick Woodman, 39, is set to be named America's highest-paid CEO of 2014  Woodman's product - a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, or a hand-held pole - made waves in when it debuted in 2006.  They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering six-foot waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife Jill giving birth to one of their sons.  The Californian surfing couple have come a long way since the business was founded in 2004 with one product: a waterproof film camera. Before sales took off, Woodman posed as the model for their self-made adverts. But his posing days didn't last long. In 2006, the firm launched its first digital camera. Three years later it began selling a high-definition camera. The cameras are light, small and waterproof. They have other uses besides sports. TV producers use them to film in areas where big professional cameras can't go. Since launching its high-definition camera in 2009, it has sold 8.5 million of them, including 3.8 million in 2013. Its cameras are sold in more than 25,000 stores and cost between $200 and $400.  The day the company first went public, they sold 3.6 million shares of GoPro stock to rake in an astounding $86 million before taxes.

The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife giving birth to one of their sons. They are WiFi capable, typically come with remotes for control and have a capacity of 64GB currently. They are also versatile thanks to numerous add-ons, including LCD screens, and the most expensive model is $400.  Woodman's father, Dean, has also found himself an overnight millionaire. The elder Woodman loaned his son $200,000 to help get GoPro off the ground. Dean Woodman - who sold none of his shares at the IPO - now owns $280 million in GoPro shares. As Forbes notes, that is a 140,000 percent return on his initial $200,000 investment.   Its list of competitors is short, but growing. Consumer electronics companies Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market. GoPro had the best-selling camcorder in 2013, according to government paperwork filed by the company. It also sells accessories such as cases, battery packs and mounts that help users attach their cameras to surfboards, helmets or their wrists. It also has a free app and software that lets users edit, store and publish their videos to their social media accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Additional growth may come from the wild videos its cameras create, which the company hopes to use to create a media company.

{"article": "A humble wooden deckchair recovered from the doomed Titanic has sold for £100,350 at auction. The Nantucket wooden chair, which once sat on a first-class promenade of the ill-fated ship, was salvaged by a search team from the Atlantic Ocean after the Titanic sank in 1912.  Dubbed 'one of the rarest types of Titanic collectable', the chair is too fragile to sit on, but has been carefully preserved, having been owned by a British collector for the past 15 years. A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected sold for £100,000 at auction The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett.  The anonymous seller kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast, never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item.  It was sold yesterday at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Devizes, Wiltshire, to a UK buyer.  Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'.   He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today. Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova Scotia Titanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14 It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic He said that he was 'very, very pleased' with the price. The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic.  Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001. Sold with the chair was an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic. Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years ago It includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s. In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired. 'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.' Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia. He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story. 'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.' Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14.

The former Illinois governor has return to his roots while inside and has been photographed with his still full head of hair a shocking white color rather than the boot polish black that was his trademark as a politician. Blagojevich was infamously caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president in 2008. Fade to gray: Once famed for his mop of blacker than black hair, disgraced Democrat Rod Blagojevich, 58, has really let his haircare regime go while he serves his prison time Back in his days as governor of Illinois, Blagojevich was famed for his boot polish black hair He was impeached and removed from office by the state Legislature in early 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver. The photos, the first of Blagojevich in prison, were first published by the National Enquirer. The photos show the former governor sitting at a desk, reading a book and wearing glasses and sitting outside in shorts and a wife beater shirt. While he continues to awaiting word on a last-ditch appeal, Blagojevich has daily contact with his family and teaches the history of war battles to other inmates, his attorney said. Last July lawyers attempted to argue that a high court ruling in McCutcheon v. the Federal Election Commission in April 2014 bolstered their view that Blagojevich was engaged in legal, run-of-the-mill political horse trading, not corruption. The McCutcheon ruling, they argued, found that soliciting contributions crosses the line into corruption only when a politician makes a clear, explicit promise to take official action in return for a donation. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver after he was caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president In that context, defense attorneys said the trial judge was wrong to set a lower standard for jurors by telling them, to convict, they only needed to find that Blagojevich sought donations 'knowing or believing' it would be given for some official act. But government attorneys responded saying that Blagojevich's legal team hadn't correctly characterized the Supreme Court's findings in McCutcheon. 'The decision provides no support for Blagojevich's argument on appeal,' the two-page filing said.  'Nothing in the (McCutcheon) decision suggests that an exchange of contributions for specific official acts is quid pro quo corruption only if the arrangement is stated 'explicitly' or 'expressly.''

{"article": "David Crossley developed large kidney stones Like many busy people, David Crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch, and often barely stopped for a cup of tea. In fact, David, 63, a musculoskeletal therapist from Birmingham, admits: 'I would often be so busy at the clinic that I'd forget to drink any liquid at all, other than the odd cup of tea or coffee. It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.' Last year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back. 'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.' This revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth. The stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. 'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting. Once on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating. Sometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine. The bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year. Meanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340.  The cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake And bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women. 'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.' The main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care. 'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through. 'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.' To avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise. Changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up. 'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith. 'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor). 'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.' There are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too. But low-carb diets could also put you at risk So the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones. Obesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi. This causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney. Eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind. Oxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities. If you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith. Virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi. But if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone. 'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.' For bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone. For very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road). David Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September. 'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.' He knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle. 'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi. The British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; ½ pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt. Mr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones. Today, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says.

Hughes hoped to raise awareness about the influence of big money in politics by deliberately breaking the law to deliver 535 letters, one for each member of Congress.  Instead, the overwhelming focus of news coverage has been about the gaps he exposed in national security. He told The Associated Press: 'We've got bigger problems in this country than worrying about whether the security around DC is ironclad. 'We need to be worried about the piles of money that are going into Congress.

{"article": "Police are using tiny plastic Lego figures in a campaign to warn people about the rising tide of housebreakings in Scotland. Officers from Police Scotland's Edinburgh division – which has seen break-ins soar by nearly 40 per cent – posted pictures of the Lego models on their Facebook page as part of a move to raise awareness of crime. Last night, victims branded the move as 'insensitive' and 'a joke'.  Hands up: Plastic Lego figures are being used by police as part of a quirky campaign to warn people about the dangers of housebreaking. But the move received a backlash, with victims branding it as 'a joke' The police internet posting showed scenes of Lego criminals attempting to break into people's homes before being arrested by officers – and were accompanied by a Scots dialect poem giving advice. But the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes. Break-ins in Edinburgh rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to April 2014, with 4,101 homes hit. Across Scotland, housebreakings rose 4 per cent to 22,272 over the same period. The row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations, rather than pounding the beat. Last year, critics claimed many officers were having to 'backfill' – being taken off beat duties to carry out office jobs previously covered by civilian workers. Be vigilant: The Lego figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people's homes. Last night Police Scotland defended the campaign Last night, Police Scotland defended the campaign, pointing out that the photos have been viewed almost 350,000 times. But Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: 'With housebreaking on the increase, officers should be out solving real crimes, rather than relying on Lego to try and prevent it.' The pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive, Operation RAC. They were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling the city's housebreaking problem. One image shows a Lego figurine in a hat and standing beside a door. Another shows a man standing on a ledge with another figure below. Poems were posted alongside the pictures, with one reading: 'Staying in or goin oot? Lock the windaes 'n' front door. A simple step maybe, that'll prevent access tae them on the chore.' 'Keep yer hame safe when yer oot on the go, By usin' timers on lights 'n' even the radio, Timers are cheap 'n' it takes seconds tae do, And it cuid prevent ye fae calling the boys in blue.' 'Look how ye get access tae the back o' yer hame, If it's easy others wull dae the same, Restrict access tae the rear, And help prevent others fae choring yer gear.' One victim of housebreaking, Tamara Swanson from Newhaven, Edinburgh, was not impressed. The 20-year-old was alone in her home last July when an intruder attacked her as she was getting out of the shower. The man grabbed her from behind, punched her and then tried to strangle her before she managed to escape. Speaking last night, she said police had done little to help her since the incident. 'We had to keep phoning them [Police Scotland],' she said. 'I'm still going to a psychiatrist and they're putting a lot of anxiety down to this. I wasn't sleeping for months. I didn't feel safe at all.' Speaking about the online campaign, she said: 'They're [people online] not going to look at it and think, \"That's interesting\" and do anything about it.' Her father, Peter Swanson, added: 'Why would they bother doing that? Lego? It's a joke. Police Scotland is a waste of time. 'It's a money-saving thing, obviously to the detriment of policing. The cartoons are stupid. Get the guys back on the street.' Another housebreaking victim, Michael Wright said the pictures were 'terrible' and 'insensitive'. His house in the Inch area of Edinburgh was broken into just before Christmas, with thieves taking money he had set aside for presents, as well as his Ford Fiesta. Mr Wright, whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident, said: 'Could they not have used the resources elsewhere, rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with Lego sets? 'When I saw that, I thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries. They have nothing better to be doing than sitting behind their computer on Facebook.' Watch out: The campaign was shared on social media with fun poems. Pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling Edinburgh's housebreaking problem He added: 'Most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s. They don't have Facebook or social media, so how are they supposed to get the message?' Chief Supt Mark Williams, Edinburgh divisional commander, said: 'Over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages.
