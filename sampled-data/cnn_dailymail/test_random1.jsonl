Almost everyone longs to be reunited with deceased friends and family. Now an app dubbed 'Project Elysium' claims to do just that by creating a 'personalised afterlife experience' with loved ones who have passed. The app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will work Created by Australia-based Paranormal Games, the app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will work. What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model. An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick.' Dr Albert Rizzo, director of medical virtual reality at the University of Southern California said he believes potential users would have to send pictures and video of the deceased to the developer. What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model. An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick' But the company may also need to harvest even more data so that they can construct the person's personality, mannerisms and movements. 'If I knew I had an incurable disease, maybe I would do a full body scan and have a digital replica created,' Dr Rizzo told DailyMail.com. 'And I would sit down for 20 hours and have people ask me questions about my life and what I think about different things.' He says this can all be programmed into virtual reality to create a living record of someone that people can interact with using VR headsets such as Oculus Rift. But experts are divided over how this can impact a user's mental health. Some argue that it can provide real comfort and support in times of grief, while others say it may prevent people from moving on from trauma. Bina48 is a robotic head that uses a 'Mind Clone' of the memories, belief and feelings of a real person It may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years, according to a leading pioneer of the technology. The technology, which is similar to that seen in the film Transcendence starring Johnny Depp, is being developed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt. She has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic 'clone' of her wife Bina that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology. The robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of Bina by creating a database of her memories, beliefs and thoughts, along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares. This allows the robot, called Bina48, to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real, living person. Mrs Rothblatt, 60, an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman, believes the these 'Mind Clones' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died. 'I think helping people to confront difficult emotional challenges done in a safe environment is a positive thing,' said Dr Rizzo. 'When people avoid processing things, this is when it comes back and haunts them.' 'I don't think there is any disrespect to the dead to want to view them and interact with them,' he added.

Furious Tracey Taylor, 34, caused more than £13,000 worth of damage to the luxury cars including scratching the paintwork with a key and smashing the BMW's windscreen with a rock. Earlier that day she had attacked her former lover and his girlfriend, punching him on the ear and pulling her hair after barging her way into her home in Ratby, Leics. Then two days later she returned to the property and broke in through the front door, pushing her way past her love rival's 19-year-old student daughter before tearing a flatscreen TV off the wall and hurling a vase of roses across the room. When arrested she told the police she'd attacked the cars on February 18 this year because she saw they had a Porsche and a BMW between them when he'd left her 'penniless.'  Leicester Crown Court heard how Taylor had been struggling to come to terms with the breakdown of the 20 year relationship with the father of her two daughters, aged 12 and four, and a 15-year-old son.  Recorder Mark Hill QC, sentencing, told Taylor, of Desford, Leics: 'You were unable to control your temper and your appalling behaviour brings discredit upon you. 'You displayed a high level of anger and violence, carried out in the presence of two young children, causing extensive and serious damage.' Lynsey Knott, defending, said: 'It was a life-long relationship since she was 15. 'She's a devoted mother, has no previous convictions, and is ashamed two of her children were present. 'She'd assisted her partner with the running of the businesses and after the breakdown was left without a home, whilst waiting for a housing association property. Taylor received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement 'She was at rock-bottom and is truly sorry. Her doctor has increased her anti-depressant medication.' The court heard £9,800 pounds' worth of damage was caused to the Porsche and £3,800 to the BMW - including key scratch marks.

She was also handed a five-year restraining order was made, banning her from contacting her ex-lover's new partner or her teenage daughter. Taylor's ex-partner, aged 40, who runs a car business, asked not to be named, but said after the case: 'It's been the most stressful year of my life, since we broke up. 'It's been a complete nightmare with all the damage, threats, outbursts and driving at me before crashing into the cars in front of our daughters.

{"article": "A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities.

{"article": "A simple breath test that could help detect the early stages of stomach cancer has been developed by scientists. The screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development. By looking for distinctive 'breath prints', researchers were also able to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease. Scroll down for video  In and out: Thanks to a breath test, researchers claim there were able to detect the early stages of stomach cancer and also to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease (stock image) Israeli researchers say the system is accurate, cheap – and allows patients to be monitored without using invasive procedures. The discovery comes as scientists in the US made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours. The breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. About 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the UK each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed. Research leader Professor Hossam Haick of the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Haifa, said: 'The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, insensitivity to confounding factors, and potentially low cost.' Breathe: The tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development (stock image) Previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer, but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes. In the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer. They were analysed by so-called nanomaterial sensors, which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient's breath. The test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. The researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies, an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube.  A large trial involving thousands of patients, including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes, is currently under way in Europe to test the technology's suitability as a screening method, they add. Meanwhile, US experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease. The findings, published in the scientific journal Oncogene, raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset. The results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers – and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous. Professor Renny Franceschi, of the University of Michigan, said it paves the way for a 'warning light' that signals how dangerous the cancer is. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present. But they are unreliable, holding a high risk of 'false positives' that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer. Professor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.", "id": "13", "highlights": "Tests spot chemical signals in exhaled air linked to tumour development ..

{"article": "Easter is here! And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline. According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.'   This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight.  A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off Indulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats.  For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules.  A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes.  One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off. The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitness Experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward Two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running. Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume. 'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said. Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat. He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then. 'What we're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time. That way when holidays, like Easter, come around they don't have to feel like they have to deny themselves,' he said.", "id": "33", "highlights": "The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' for four mini Easter eggs it would take 30-40 minutes of walking to work off..

{"article": "On the surface, the mix-up seems incomprehensible: How can a volunteer sheriff's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a Taser, killing a man? That's apparently what happened in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when a 73-year-old reserve deputy, Robert Bates, killed Eric Harris. Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead. \"Oh! I shot him. I'm sorry,\" Bates said in a video of the shooting. But it's happened before. In a well-publicized 2009 case, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland, California. The former officer, Johannes Mehserle, testified that he had meant to use his Taser but drew his gun instead. Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct. So how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a Taser? Here are some factors to consider: Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body, and the Taser should be placed on the nondominant side. So if an officer is left-handed, the gun should be on the left side. Bates' attorney said his client is left-handed. But the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side. \"I shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed,\" Bates said in a written statement to investigators. After Bates announced at the scene he was going to use his Taser, he \"used his nondominant hand, and it was the gun,\" said Clark Brewster, Bates' attorney. \"He said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder, assumed it was the Taser,\" Brewster said. \"Both the gun and the Taser have a laser sight, and he just made a mistake.\" Brewster also said his client's left hand was holding a pepper gun. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had grabbed a \"pepper ball launcher\" to try to slow or stop Harris, who was running away. Bates did not say explicitly where the Taser was on his body. But he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was \"startled\" by the recoil of the gun. \"After realizing what had happened I was in a state of shock and disbelief,\" he told investigators. Bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison. Deputy who shot Eric Harris turns himself in Bates was carrying his personal gun, a Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolver, and a Model X26 Taser, he said in his statement to investigators. Attorneys representing the Harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices. One held up a small black .357 revolver, followed by a mostly bright yellow Taser that was noticeably larger than the gun. \"There's no way an officer can get this confused with this,\" said one of the attorneys from the law firm of Smolen, Smolen & Roytman. Taser's X26 model comes in different designs. Some are mostly yellow, while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle. But all appear to be larger than Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolvers. Sgt. Jim Clark of the Tulsa Police Department -- which is separate from the county sheriff's office for which Bates volunteered -- said Bates was the \"victim\" of something called \"slip and capture.\" That's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation. But a criminal justice expert told CNN the claim amounts to \"junk science.\" \"There's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this. ... It's not generally accepted by the scientific community,\" said Phil Stinson, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University. \"So it's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence.\" An attorney for the Harris family said the \"slip and capture\" theory hasn't held up in court. \"The only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in Oakland (of Oscar Grant),\" the attorney said. And that defense failed. Tasers are built to feel and look different than guns, according to Taser International. Steve Tuttle, vice president for strategic communications at Taser, noted some of those differences to CNN: A gun is heavier. A Taser has a different grip and feel. When you take the safety off on a Taser, an LED control panel lights up. There's more: Tasers can be different colors (yellow or black), and the holster is different from a gun's. But in the field, where an officer reacts on instinct, there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important, Tuttle said. Taser's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer's nondominant side, as law enforcement experts say. And its training suggests that officers shout aloud, \"Taser! Taser! Taser!\" as they prepare to deploy it. These guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for. It is up to each law enforcement department, however, in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body. The company declined to comment on the Tulsa shooting in particular. The stun guns, or conducted electrical weapons, manufactured by Taser have been used more than 2.7 million times, Tuttle said, and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death.

Shoichet, Brooke Baldwin, Ed Lavandera and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.", "id": "21", "highlights": "Attorney: Robert Bates assumed the gun was a Taser because he saw a laser sight on it..

{"article": "The Wikipedia official who accused Grant Shapps of doctoring his own online biography was exposed yesterday as a former Liberal Democrat member. The Tory party chairman had been accused this week of using an anonymous user ID to delete embarrassing facts about his past and add unflattering details about his political rivals. But yesterday it emerged that the senior Wikipedia administrator who investigated the allegations - following a tip-off from the left-wing Guardian - was a former Lib-Dem member. Richard Symonds, 29, who goes by the online name 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry', is one of the UK's top administrators for the website. He once described himself as 'Liberal Democrat to the last'. Scroll down for video  Volunteer: Richard Symonds, who joined the Wikipedia project in 2004, says he was not being political Mr Symonds decided to block a user called 'Contribsx' on Tuesday after concluding the account was probably operated either by Mr Shapps or under his 'clear direction'. Mr Shapps angrily denied the claims, insisting the story was 'untrue from start to finish'. Mr Symonds' decision was also criticised by other Wikipedia activists, who warned that the site should not be used to 'play politics' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee. One user wrote: 'I don't know if 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry' did anything wrong but it's just rather obscure, and doing this during the peak campaign time for the UK 2015 elections as some sort of assignment from a journalist seems odd.' Mr Symonds, from Bow, East London, described himself on Twitter as 'Liberal Democrat (to the last)' before deleting his profile yesterday. He joined other party members who signed a letter to The Guardian in January last year calling for Lord Rennard to have the Lib-Dem whip withdrawn over his refusal to apologise for making unwanted advances to female activists. The internet expert, who has served in the Royal Naval Reserve, has been a Wikipedia volunteer since 2004 and became an administrator for the website in 2007. He is also a paid employee of Wikimedia UK, a charity which promotes the volunteer-written encyclopedia. Furious denials: Grant Shapps yesterday continued to deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes Among his Facebook friends is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who married Tony Blair's former diary secretary Kate Garvey in 2012. He was once featured in a BBC profile that called him 'one of the UK's top Wikipedians' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site. Responding to the criticism yesterday, Mr Symonds insisted he was not a Lib-Dem activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his Wikipedia work. He added: 'I have never considered myself 'active' in any party, although I have been a lapsed member of the Lib Dems on and off, for probably a year in total since 2010.' Mr Symonds toned down his conclusions about Mr Shapps' possible connections to 'Contribsx', revisions to one of his Wikipedia pages show. At first he claimed the Tory chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly, but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called 'Hackneymarsh' who was linked to Mr Shapps' office by The Guardian in 2012. Mr Symonds admitted that Wikipedia's top officials had 'chastised' him for his handling of the case, although he refused to back down yesterday. He said: 'While a link has clearly been drawn between Hackneymarsh and Contribsx, it is impossible to know who was sitting behind the keyboard of Contribsx. 'But given the nature of edits, I suspect that it was Mr Shapps or someone close to him.' The Liberal Democrats used the claims to poke fun at the Tory chairman when the story broke on Tuesday night, and senior figures in the party continued mocking him yesterday. Lib-Dem leader Nick Clegg said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been 'Michael Green', the pseudonym used by Mr Shapps to promote get-rich-quick schemes before he became an MP. A Lib-Dem spokesman said Mr Symonds had 'no connection to Lib Dem HQ'. 'The first time we saw this story was in the Guardian, and the first time we know about him was when we were asked about him this afternoon,' he added. Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits Mr Shapps yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes, and Tory cabinet ministers rallied behind him. He said: 'It's categorically untrue. It's absolutely nothing to do with me. It's just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.' David Cameron came to his defence, insisting the Welwyn Hatfield MP was doing a 'great job'. Wikimedia UK spokesman Stevie Benton said to the best of his knowledge Mr Symonds did not brief the Liberal Democrats about his actions. 'I would be incredibly surprised if he had done and would say it's out of character,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I've worked with Richard for three and a half years and his politics have never entered into anything in that time.' The Guardian rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the Wikipedia inquiry into alleged links between 'Contribsx' and Mr Shapps. A spokeswoman for the paper said: 'The article clearly states that this was a Guardian investigation which brought to light some potential breaches of Wikipedia's own rules, which were then communicated to the site's administrators.' Unite leader Len McCluskey has become embroiled in a claim against his trade union for bullying and sexual harassment. As part of a constructive dismissal claim under investigation by an employment tribunal, former union official Sally Nailard has accused the Unite general secretary of calling her a 'scab'. The 50-year-old former regional officer based at Heathrow is seeking undisclosed compensation. The case lifts the lid on alleged 'discrimination, misogyny and bullying' at the hard-Left union. The chairman of the employment tribunal in Watford, Isabel Manley, described the case as a 'sad and sorry tale'. More than half of Labour candidates in its 106 target seats are linked to Unite. Mr McCluskey is one of several union officials cited in Miss Nailard's claim. She resigned from her £47,000 position last August, following an alleged 18-month campaign of bullying and harassment. Her evidence submitted to the tribunal, seen by the Independent, relates to a copy of an interview she gave to Sky News in 1997 after a cabin crew strike which she didn't take part in. Her evidence states: 'If I was such a \"scab\" as Len McCluskey later said, I would have volunteered to operate as crew over the strike.'

Their concern about Wilshere, 23, who has over two years left on his Arsenal deal, is his injury record. He has yet to return to Arsene Wenger's side since having surgery on his troublesome left ankle in November. There is a well-trodden path between Arsenal and City over the past five years.  The Manchester club, who offer far bigger salaries, have spent £80million on Samir Nasri, Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy. Frank Lampard was among the few English representatives for Manchester City at Selhurst Park Joe Hart (centre) was the only England player that started while James Milner (right) came on as a sub Wilshere played 90 minutes for Arsenal as he stepped up in his return from injury at the Emirates Henderson clears the ball during Liverpool's defeat by Arsenal at the Emirates in the Premier League And City will certainly need to make bids in excess of £30m to tempt Arsenal or Liverpool to sell. Not all of City's targets will be English, though, with the club willing to use France star Nasri and Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko as bait in a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. Pogba, a 22-year-old France international, was on Manchester United's books before moving to Italy. City see him as the long-term successor to the fading Yaya Toure, although Pogba could cost as much as £60m. Nasri and Dzeko have had poor seasons and are expected to be part of a summer cull.  Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is another target of those at the Etihad for this summer's transfer market Pogba, a 22-year-old France international, was on Manchester United's books before leaving for Italy", "id": "22", "highlights": "Manchester City know they need more English players in their line-up..

{"article": "Facinet Keita was representing Guinea in the 2012 Olympics when he was knocked out in the qualifying stages An Olympic judo star from Africa is still fighting to stay in Britain – three years after flying here for the London Games then refusing to leave. Facinet Keita, 31, fled the Olympic village in summer 2012, claiming his failure to win a medal meant he 'would be murdered' if he returned to his native Guinea. His wife who was left to look after the couple's two children has now split from him because she 'couldn't wait for him'. Mr Keita – the official flag-bearer for the West African nation during the opening ceremony – said he decided to go on the run after losing to an opponent from the Pacific island of Guam within five minutes.  He said: 'My coaches told me I had lost the fight like a baby. They said I embarrassed my country and I would be in big trouble when we are at home.' After three months sleeping rough, Mr Keita handed himself in to authorities and was locked up in an immigration detention centre. While there he made two requests for asylum, both of which were rejected. After the second failed request, he was told he had to leave Britain on December 17, 2013. He agreed to board a plane to Ghana, but upon arrival there he said that he was turned back because he did not have the correct travel documents. He returned to Britain and was once again detained.  However, he was released in March 2014 and has since been coaching judo in Stoke-on-Trent. He now plans to make a third application for asylum. Mr Keita said he has built a new life in Britain and has met friends who have become like family. 'The people here are really welcoming, if you show them you are a good person,' he added.

Mr Keita denies he has stayed in Britain to claim benefits. He said: 'My situation is difficult, 100 per cent difficult. I want to be near my family and I want to see them but I can't.' His request to stay in Britain has been backed by the African Social Health Agency, which supports asylum seekers. It described Mr Keita as an asset to the local community. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases. 'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we consider every claim on its individual merits.

Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy. Batschelet warns that current trends mean as many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Scroll down for video  As many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy 'The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,' he told CNN. 'We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 percent, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army. It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.' Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent didn't qualify because they were overweight.  According to the CDC, 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. Army recruiters, facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up, have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser. Boot camp: The maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females The recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp.  Many still fail to make the grade, but some do - such as a female recruit from Kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up. 'We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,' said Batschelet. 'We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.' The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females.   The maximum a female soldier, aged 17-20, can weigh is 227 pounds, while the maximum for a male soldier in the same age group is 234 pounds and in both instances that is dependent on being 80 inches tall. Obesity rates have tripled in a generation with more than one-third of U.S. adults now considered obese, while 17 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese.

Paul Monk, 54, from Essex, was wanted by Spanish police for questioning over the kidnap and murder of Francis Brennan, whose badly decomposed body washed up on a Costa Blanca beach in March last year. He was also wanted by the Metropolitan Police on drug offences and had been named on a list of fugitives published as part of the National Crime Agency's Operation Captura campaign ahead of his detention. This is the dramatic moment that fugitive Paul Monk was arrested by heavily armed police in his Alicante villa Paul Monk, 54, from Essex, was wanted by Spanish police for questioning over the kidnap and murder of Francis Brennan Spanish police released footage of their dramatic swoop.

His body was wrapped in an industrial-size bin bag with duct tape round it when it appeared on a beach in nearby Orihuela Costa. Civil Guard officers in Alicante confirmed today they believe Monk, from Essex, may be implicated in the violent death and named him as an associate of Paul Scott. Scott, 32, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine after being caught trying to sneak into Britain in a light aircraft last December. He was also wanted for questioning over Mr Brennan's murder when he was detained. Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime. Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool. An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly £100,000 in cash were also found. He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences. He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013. A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested. 'He got other people to bring him food and other things in the villa where he hid out, leading the life of an authentic fugitive.'

Mr Brennan, from Liverpool, was himself on the run after leaving Britain while awaiting sentence in the UK over the wounding of a man at a Swedish House Mafia music concert in Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire. He travelled to the Costa del Sol with his girlfriend towards the end of 2013 after ignoring the advice of his parents to stay in Britain.

{"article": "Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.

{"article": "A Tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting. Jonny Bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a Labour rival, Theo Blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand: Jonny Bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of Camden Council in north London, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn was caught playing Scrabble during a Richmond Council budget meeting in south-west London. Telling off: Mayor of Camden Council, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, had to tell Mr Bucknell to stop eating When he first noticed him eating, Mr Blackwell told his fellow councillors: 'It appears that one of our Tory colleagues is consuming a full Sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. 'Could I ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky Snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal. Mr Bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents Belsize, Hampstead, told the Evening Standard: 'I never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber. 'They should definitely repeal it. There is nothing wrong with nibbling from a lunch box if you are being discreet. 'It is not as if a cold meal is going to waft around like a McDonald's. 'I will be campaigning for the repealing of the law that says you can't nibble from a lunch box in the council chamber.' The Conservative councillor said the meal, in a plastic box, had travelled home with him after a French snowboarding holiday. 'The chalet always brought out too much food and I can't stand wasting food,' he said. He previously found fame when he slept in his Volvo car to save on hotel bills during the Conservative party conference in September 2013. Mr Bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called 'ridiculous prices'. He said the economy would improve if more people were thrifty like him.  After the council meeting mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli said: 'I understand councillors do a difficult job and sometimes don't get time to eat dinner. 'I also tend to be quite flexible, but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much.'
